# SharkAttack
A group project made with 2 of my classmates during my first year Digital Media studies (DATT 1000). It was created using MaxMSP and MaxMSP's openGL renderer.

It is a game where you must avoid getting eaten by a shark. The longer you survive, the higher you score.
Don't have footage or screenshots as this project was really old and no longer have the software to play or test it on.
