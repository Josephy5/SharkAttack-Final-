# SharkAttack
MaxMSP group project with 2 of my classmates during my first year Digital Media studies (DATT 1000). 

It is a game where you must avoid getting eaten by a shark. Built using MaxMSP and MaxMSP's openGL feature.
Don't have footage or screenshots as this project was really old and no longer have the software to play or test it on.
